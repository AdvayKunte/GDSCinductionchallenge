# Task 3 is the main task , I tried to increase the accuracy by various data preprocessing techniques but still couldn't get past the 55 percent accuracy on testing data .
# However i explored many new data processing things like oversampling ,outlier detection , replacing NaN values etc. in quest to increase the accuracy and found it more challenging with multiclass classifcation problems etc.
# Hence i have also attached the Task 2 , which i approached using linear regression and got satisfactory accuracy for the same

# It is better if you could locally run the python files with both the excel files downloaded in the same folder and run the code in command prompt of the PC by using streamlit run filename.py
