# GDSCinductionchallenge
# Task 3 is the main task , I tried to increase the accuracy by various data preprocessing techniques but still couldn't get past the 55 percent accuracy on testing data .
# However i explored many new data processing things like oversampling ,outlier detection , replacing NaN values etc. in quest to increase the accuracy and found it more challenging with multiclass classifcation problems etc.
# Hence i have also attached the Task 2 , which i approached using linear regression and got satisfactory accuracy for the same
